						<strong class="faq-question">
							Why do I need to enter my Snapchat or WeChat ID during sign up?
						</strong>

					</div>
					<div class="faq-item">
						<strong class="faq-question">

				<strong class="faq-question">
					What is a Ypoint and what is it for?
				</strong>
				<p class="faq-answer">
					If you are not connected to a City Network, Whispers cost YERO points
					(Ypoints). Half of the Ypoints used to send a disconnected Whisper go to
					the receiving user. As long as you connect to a venue, Whispers have no
					cost for 12 hours.
