						<strong class="faq-question">
							What's the difference between connecting and joining a network?
						</strong>
						<p class="faq-answer">
							 Connecting to a network does not mean you are discoverable. You must join the network to become discoverable. Think of joining a network as going online. 
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="faq-item">
						<strong class="faq-question">
							Why does joining a network last until 5 AM?
						</strong>
						<p class="faq-answer">
							There may be some nights where you don't want people to discover you&mdash;we get that. When joining a network, you make yourself discoverable for just tonight.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="faq-item">
						<strong class="faq-question">
							What's a Whisper?
						</strong>

					</div>
					<div class="faq-item">
						<strong class="faq-question">
							Why do I need to enter my Snapchat or WeChat ID during sign up?

					</div>
					<div class="faq-item">

						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="faq-item">
						<strong class="faq-question">
							Why are we limited to Snapchat or WeChat?

						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="faq-item">
						<strong class="faq-question">
							Why donâ€™t you support WhatsApp?

						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="faq-item">
						<strong class="faq-question">
							Why does everyone automatically disconnect at 5 AM?
						</strong>
						<p class="faq-answer">

					<div class="faq-item">
						<strong class="faq-question">
							What exactly is a venue network?
						</strong>
						<p class="faq-answer">
							A private network designed to surround a specific club, lounge or festival. Upon arrival, you'll connect to the venue's network if the venue is listed under the Venues tab. Just walk inside with Wi-Fi enabled.

					</div>
					<div class="faq-item">
						<strong class="faq-question">
							Can other people see which venue I'm inside?
						</strong>
						<p class="faq-answer">
							No. Only people in the same venue can see which venue you are inside. People outside the venue network cannot see which venue you're in&mdash;they only see that you are in 'another venue.'
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="faq-item">
						<strong class="faq-question">
							So people in the same venue can see me if I join a venue network?
						</strong>
						<p class="faq-answer">
							Yes. This is no different than a real-world scenario. At least now you have an alternative to physically approaching someone.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="faq-item">
						<strong class="faq-question">
							How does someone get a 'same venue' or 'another venue' badge?
						</strong>
						<p class="faq-answer">

						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="faq-item">
						<strong class="faq-question">
							How long does a 'same venue' or 'another venue' badge last for?
						</strong>
						<p class="faq-answer">
							Both badges last until you exit the venue network or when Yero disconnects all users at 5 am (whichever comes first).
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="faq-item">
						<strong class="faq-question">
							Do I need to keep Wi-Fi on to keep the badge?
						</strong>
						<p class="faq-answer">
							No. However, there's a chance that we won't be able to verify your precise location anymore (our satellites work long hours).
