				<strong class="faq-question">
					Is the app free?
				</strong>
				<p class="faq-answer">
					Yes, the app will always be free. Some features will require Y-points,
					which can be obtained by using the app or through payment.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="faq-item">
				<strong class="faq-question">
					What do I need to use this app?
				</strong>
				<p class="faq-answer">
					An iPhone 4s+ with a data connection and Bluetooth enabled.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="faq-item">
				<strong class="faq-question">
					Why do I need Bluetooth enabled?
				</strong>
				<p class="faq-answer">
					We use the latest advancements in Bluetooth Low Energy technology
					to detect when YERO users enter the proximity of a venue. This way,
					we can verify when a YERO user is indeed out tonight.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="faq-item">
				<strong class="faq-question">
					Is there any Bluetooth connection to other users?
				</strong>
				<p class="faq-answer">
					No. YERO users <em>never</em> connect with each other via Bluetooth. Instead,
					users connect to a venue-specific transmitter that has been installed.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="faq-item">
				<strong class="faq-question">
					Will Bluetooth impact my phone's battery?
				</strong>
				<p class="faq-answer">
					No. Bluetooth Low Energy is the industry standard for device
					connectivity simply because of its unnoticeable battery drain.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="faq-item">
				<strong class="faq-question">
					Will people be able to find out which venue I'm in?
				</strong>
				<p class="faq-answer">
					Never. Only people in your current venue will know that you're also in
					the same venue (which is the same as a real-world scenario)
.				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="faq-item">
				<strong class="faq-question">
					Why does the app use GPS?
				</strong>
				<p class="faq-answer">
					We sort venues and people by the distance around you - GPS is
					necessary to accomplish this.
				</p>

			<div class="faq-item">
				<strong class="faq-question">
					Why is there a City Network and a Venue Network?
				</strong>
				<p class="faq-answer">
					Once you leave a Venue Network, you're still out tonight. We wanted to
					keep users on the network even after they exit a venue - the City
					Network solves this.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="faq-item">
				<strong class="faq-question">
					What does the Venue Network do?
				</strong>
				<p class="faq-answer">
					The Venue Network does 4 thigns:
					<ol>
						<li>Grants you access to the City Network</li>
						<li>Greets users with a message containing venue-specific information</li>
						<li>Allows you to send and receive Whispers from users in the same venue.</li>
						<li>Gives venues the ability to interact with their crowds in real-time.</li>
					</ol>
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="faq-item">
				<strong class="faq-question">
					What does the City Network do?
				</strong>
				<p class="faq-answer">
					The City Network allows you to remain discoverable by other users even
					after exiting a venue. City Networks connection lasts up to 12 hours.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="faq-item">
				<strong class="faq-question">
					What is a Whisper?
				</strong>
				<p class="faq-answer">
					An anonymous chat request that reveals your first name and age.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="faq-item">
				<strong class="faq-question">
					What is a Ypoint and what is it for?
				</strong>
				<p class="faq-answer">
					If you are not connected to a City Network, Whispers cost YERO points
					(Ypoints). Half of the Ypoints used to send a disconnected Whisper go to
					the receiving user. As long as you connect to a venue, Whispers have no
					cost for 12 hours.
