			<h3>Tonight’s Network</h3>
			<p>Yero is all about tonight. We believe meeting new friends is awesome. We also believe that context can help remove awkwardness and break the ice. That's why we designed Yero. On the surface, Yero is another location-based social network&mdash;but it's much more than that. We create invisible networks around places where meeting new friends makes a lot of sense&mdash;clubs, colleges and festivals. We know that asking you to check-in is one step too many and that sometimes you'll enter a network without even knowing, so we made the experience seamless, simple and fun. Just walk around like you normally would and Yero will notify you when you walk into one of our invisible networks&mdash;even if the app isn't open. Go ahead and ask someone new what they're up to tonight, comment about a photo on their Instagram or take the conversation onto Snapchat, Line or WeChat. We give you the context and opportunity to make new friends—the rest is up to you! </p>
